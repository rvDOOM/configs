# My Arch Linux Configuration
A collection of my config files for various apps in all one place

## Mission
My goal is to have all of my configuration files in one consolidated space. 

## Symlink Bash Script
This script creates symlinks for all necessary configs and scripts so all of the config files are linked to where they need to be. 

## Current App Stack
These are the current apps installed on my system:

- `Hyprland` [Git](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland): Tiling Wayland compositor 
- `Waybar` [Git](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar): Status bar
- `swww` [Git](https://github.com/Horus645/swww): Wallpaper daemon for Wayland
